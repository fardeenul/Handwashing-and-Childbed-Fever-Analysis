Project Title:
Handwashing and Childbed Fever Analysis

Summary:
This project explores the historical significance of handwashing in mitigating childbed fever at the Vienna General Hospital in the mid-19th century. Leveraging data on yearly and monthly births and deaths, the analysis sheds light on the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates during childbirth.

Description:
In the mid-1800s, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis discovered a correlation between handwashing and reduced mortality rates among women giving birth. This analysis delves into two datasets: yearly deaths by clinic and monthly deaths, aiming to visualize and quantify the impact of handwashing.

Key Features:

    Visualization of yearly and monthly proportions of deaths
    Identification of the point when handwashing started
    Calculation of mean proportions of deaths before and after handwashing

Technologies Used:

    R programming language
    ggplot2 for data visualization
    dplyr for data manipulation

Instructions:

    Clone the repository.
    Explore the R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
    Execute scripts to replicate the analyses.
    Review findings and insights documented in the project.

Acknowledgments:

    Data sourced from Vienna General Hospital records.
    Inspiration drawn from the work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis.
